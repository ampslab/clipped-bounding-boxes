ReadMe for distNEW, tools
=========================

Compatibility
=============
The bundles should work on all modern C based platforms, at least with
minimal adaptions.
Tested on platforms:
  Solaris, opensolaris, ubuntu, FreeBSD, Windows 7 with minGW installed.
  Tested with compilers:
  gcc, Solaris-Studio

Prerequisites (viewing files):
==============================
Under Windows, standard editors do not recognize the NL-chracter (dec. 10)
as a line break. Hence notepad++ (or any other editor recognizing LINEFEED)
should be installed.
For other prerequisites, take a look at the README in the bundle.
